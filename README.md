# Projet-Web

## About

Project submitted for a front-end course, realised by [Malcom Kojok Tarraf ](https://github.com/KhaledTarraf) and [Marianne Corbel](https://github.com/RathGate). As it is something that interests us both, we decided to work on our own version of the [Formula 1 Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/), displaying the content and data we, as casual F1 fans, would like to easily find before and after the races.

Technical documentation: HERE
How we organised our work: [HERE (Monday)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lpvbXwP1t2FPQ5lWueLt15Syn36XQ-qE/view?usp=share_link) & [HERE (Trello)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZOogSOiHAmlau366zSUJhc7TAC2B2BA/view?usp=share_link)

## Technical Specifications

 - Back-end: Golang 
 - Front-end: HTML, CSS, JS (mostly used to send minor
   ajax requests that would not require to reload the entire page).
 - API used: [Ergast Formula One API](http://ergast.com/mrd/)

For now, the program does not exactly use real-time API calls due to random shutdowns and overall instability of the Ergast Database (at least in December 2022). A temporary solution has been to save the most important part of the data into static .json when the API was working - therefore, the dynamic API calls have been temporarily commented and the fallback functions using the static files are always used instead.

**COMPATIBILITY:** The website has been entirely tested on the latest versions of Chrome (both mobile and desktop). Unintended behavior is not excluded in any other browser.

**IOS USERS:** As of Jan. 14th 2022, browsers running on iOS do not display the time conversions properly ("NaN" errors on /calendar), we do not advise you to use these for testing until the issue has been fixed.

## How to use the program

For now, the website has not been hosted anywhere, though we might find a way to host it in the future. In order to visit it on your computer, you must run the go server on your machine. 

To clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/RathGate/KOJOK-TARRAF_CORBEL_PROJET_WEB.git

Then, launch a terminal at the root of the newly cloned folder:

    go run .

**NOTE:** `go run main.go` will not work properly as the `package main` is divided into three separate files and not just contained in `main.go`.

The website should be available on `localhost:8080`. In case of port collision, look for this line of code at the bottom of `./main.go` :

    preferredPort :=  ":8080"

Change the numerical value after the colon with any other port number.

Enjoy â™«
